Crazy Idea
<forenames> = abbreviate right most first
<surnames> = abbreviate left most first
cartesian product these together
find the longest that is less than 13 (11) characters
eg:

==> forenames = bay-leigh, bay-l, b-l
==> surnames = philips-waterman, p-waterman, p-w
==> suggestions = bay-leigh.philips-waterman, bay-l.philips-waterman, b-l.philips-waterman,
                  bay-leigh.p-waterman      , bay-l.p-waterman      , b-l.p-waterman,
                  bay-leigh.p-w             , bay-l.p-w             , b-l.p-w
==> filtered = bay-leigh.p-w, bay-l.p-w, b-l.p-w
==> ordered = bay-leigh.p-w, bay-l.p-w, b-l.p-w
